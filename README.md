# OtherCities
Full-Stack Webpage to look for other cities with the same matching name as the user's input city. The data presented after the search is what openWeatherMap has on their system. 

The input fields take one or up to three of user data in case the user wants a specific result. 

Technologies used in this project include nodejs and ejs. 
	Nodejs: used express js, middleware and created endpoints to handle user's request. Used Rest api to fetch data from openWeatherMap. 
	EJS: used to dynamically print the data fetched from openWeatherMap api.
